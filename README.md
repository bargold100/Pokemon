This project includes interacting with Pokemon API, with Python request library.<br>
I created different functions that call different endpoints of the API, these functions are in the 'source' directory in the 'pokemon_functions.py' file.

In addition, I created tests for the pokemon_functions file using Python pytest library, which are in the 'tests' directory, in the 'test_pokemon_functions.py' file.
